This application is a part of the [nwg-shell](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell) project.

**Nwg-panel** is a GTK3-based panel for [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) 
Wayland compositors. The panel is equipped with a graphical configuration program that frees the user from the need to 
manually edit configuration files.

Currently, we have a dozen of modules, and we don't plan on many more. Many minor tasks that users request a module for,
may be easily done with [executors](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-panel/wiki/modules:-Executor).

- **Controls module**: basis system controls like brightness slider, volume slider (w/ per-app sliders), battery 
level w/ low level notification, system processes viewer, user-defined custom items, user-defined drop-down menu 
(which is the power menu by default);
- **Brightness slider**: a separate brightness slider for use per monitor; features backlight via ddcutil;
- **Clock**: system clock w/ a calendar popup built in;
- **Custom button**: a user-defined graphical/textual button you could bind an action to. By default, we use one as the 
application launcher button;
- **DWL tags**: deprecated and no longer supported; will be deleted in the future;
- **Executor**: a useful module that executes user-provided code and displays the output in the panel as an icon and 
text; see Wiki for more info;
- **Sway taskbar & Hyprland taskbar & Niri taskbar**: highly customizable modules to display a label with an icon for every running 
window, together with some more info (workspace number, split orientation on sway, X-widows marker); right click opens 
a menu that allows to move windows between workspaces, toggle floating and fullscreen, and also close windows;
- **Sway & Hyprland workspaces**: display labels to navigate between workspaces with a marker for non-empty ones; next
to the labels there's a field with currently focused window details;
- **Menu Start**: module provides integration of the XGD-style [nwg-menu](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-menu);
- **Openweather**: displays weather forcast from OpenWeatherMap and weather alerts from weatherbit.io for given locations;
- **Playerctl**: displays an icon and a label of the currently played tune, together with back / play-pause / forward 
buttons;
- **RandomWallpaper**: provides you with random wallpapers from either a local folder, or the [wallhaven.cc](wallhaven.cc) service. You can refresh them on startup, on demand or in a given time interval. 
You can also see the remote image info, and save the image to a local folder of your choice.
- **Scratchpad**: displays info on current scratchpad content and allows to open scratchpad windows; 
- **SwayMode**: a simple indicator of a sway bindings mode other than "default";
- **HyprlandSubmap**: a simple indicator of a Hyprland bindings submap other than "default";
- **Tray**: SNI system tray module;
- **KeyboardLayout**: keyboard layout switcher, between values defined as `xkb_layout` (sway) or `kb_layout` (Hyprland).
Use commas to separate values, e.g. `pl,us,de`.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nwg-panel.svg)](https://repology.org/project/nwg-panel/versions)

If nwg-panel has not yet been packaged for your Linux distribution, you may install it by cloning this repository
and running the `install.sh` script.

## Known issues:

If `kded6` is running (e.g., started by launching Dolphin), it may register `org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` and 
prevent nwg-panel from owning the system tray. You can stop it using:

```
pkill kded6
```
